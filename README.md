# NDEx_pre_gene_plexus

These files contain information on how to retrieve networks from NDEx and convert them to adjacency matrices, plotting small subsections of NDEx networks (given a gene list from a user), and retrieving ENTREZ gene ids from an MGI phenotype. These can all be useful for the implementation of NDEx into geneplexus

Some files are restricted to the CMSE department at MSU. If you require ENTREZ gene id conversion files, contact me at sundarsn@msu.edu
