# NDEx_pre_gene_plexus

These files contain information on how to retrieve networks from NDEx and convert them to adjacency matrices, plotting small subsections of NDEx networks (given a gene list from a user), and retrieving ENTREZ gene ids from an MGI phenotype. These can all be useful for the implementation of NDEx into geneplexus
